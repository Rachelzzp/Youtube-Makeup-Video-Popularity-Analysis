# Youtube-Makeup-Video-Popularity-Analysis
Analysis the popularity of Youtube makeup video by building models with four ML methods and create keyword cloud

For the data preprocessing part: 

Fetched large data from Youtube and cleaned data by using NLTK, bag of word and Tf-idf Vectorizer.

For model building part: 

Implemented four machine learning methods to study the correlation between word vectors and ratio of like and dislike, which are Neural Network, Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression including confusion matrix.

Results: Neural network has the highest accuracy, KNN’s accuracy is the same as LR and Linear Regression is the worst

The public focus more on the keywords on “makeup tutorial” or “eye makeup” and pays less attention on makeup videos in recent years.
